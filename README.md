## **From Shortage to Smart Allocation: A Data-Driven Driver Resource Optimization Strategy**

## âœ… Role Alignment:
This case study is designed for the **ShopeeFood Business Intelligence Analyst (Fresh Grad)** role. It simulates real-world analysis to:
- Optimize **driver resource allocation**
- Improve **budget planning**
- Enhance **driver campaign performance**

---

## âœ… Objective
To identify inefficiencies in ShopeeFoodâ€™s driver operations by analyzing supply-demand imbalances and budget leakage, and to propose cost-effective strategies to:
- Prevent driver shortages during peak hours
- Minimize idle incentives during off-peak
- Align driver resources with campaign demand

## Tools & Techniques
| Tool            | Purpose                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| SQL             | Data extraction (driver shifts, orders)|
| Excel           | Incentive cost modeling                |
| Tableau         | Visual analysis & dashboard mockups    |
| Google Looker Studio | KPI monitoring simulation         |

---

## âœ… Dataset (Simulated)
- **Driver Shifts**: ID, Region, Time, Active Hours, Earnings
- **Orders Completed**: Timestamp, Region, Campaign Flag
- **Budget Reports**: Actual vs. Projected Spend
- **Voice of Driver Surveys**: Feedback on idle time, earnings fairness

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Analysis

### 1. Supply-Demand Imbalance Mapping
- Peak shortage detected on **Fridays 6â€“9pm** (18% gap)
- Oversupply during **weekday mid-morning** (25% over)

### 2. Budget Leak Detection
- 35% of incentive budget spent during low-demand hours
- Zones with repeat idle > 1hr showed higher driver churn

### 3. Driver Segmentation
- **Full-timers**: Stable performance
- **Part-timers**: High cost-efficiency
- **Opportunistic drivers**: Consumed 42% of peak-time incentives but only completed 18% of total orders

---

## ðŸ“Œ Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Smart Budget Allocation
- Reallocate incentives based on **cost-per-order efficiency**
- Focus spend on underserved hotspots

### 2. Real-Time Supply Dashboard
- Built dashboard mockup that tracks:
  - Driver density
  - Campaign flag
  - Projected shortage zones

### 3. Adaptive Campaign Scheduling
- Auto-scale back incentives if **ROI/hour** falls below threshold
- Integrate holiday/weather forecasting for shift planning

## ðŸ“Œ Simulated Results
| Metric                         | Improvement        |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| Campaign ROI                  | +15%               |
| Idle Incentive Spend          | -22%               |
| Driver Pickup Time (Hot Zones)| Faster by 12â€“18%   |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways
- Data can drive **smarter campaign execution** and **cost control** in ShopeeFoodâ€™s driver operations.
- Even as a fresh graduate, strong analytical thinking paired with practical modeling can lead to **actionable strategy**.
- Aligning operational data with real business KPIs brings tangible results across both budget and user experience.
